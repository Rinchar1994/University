As itâ€™s known to all, China is popular for its emperor of bicycles. This is because our country is still a developing country and few people can afford private cars. The demand for a means of transport is met by making millions of bicycles available.
Riding a bicycle has a lot of advantages over driving a car. First, it is a physical exercise to ride a bicycle. In contrast, sitting in the car, one tends to gain weight. Besides, it is much more economical to ride a bike than drive a car. On the one hand, the only fee a bike-rider has to pay is the annual tax. However, the annual fees for a car are costly. On the other hand, a bike needn't be equipped with a parking lot, but a car must. Most important of all, it is beneficial to the environment to ride a bicycle because the bike doesn't consume petrol; it is a pollution-free transport. In contrast, the exhaust released by the car is harmful to the environment.
Since China is a developing country with a large population, bicycles will still be the most popular means of transport in China for quite a long time. Most people will still ride bicycles to go to work or to school. The emperor country of bicycles will remain for at least dozens of years.
